# 1st Annual Hackathon (Project A)

Topic: **Capturing a sound recording**

+ Easily allow a therapist to capture a voice recording of a patient
    + Should work anywhere on Ambiki (including the teletherapy room)
    + Could be used during an in-person session (if the therapist has their computer or device open) or during a teletherapy session
+ Incorporate the foot pedal
    + Hands-free way for the therapist to start or stop a recording
+ Ideally want to capture:
    + Sound recording
    + Patient
    + Word or phrase attempted

## USB foot pedal
